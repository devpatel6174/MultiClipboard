# MultiClipboard V1.0

This is a very rudimentary proof-of-concept idea. I've always been frustrated by needed to copy and paste multiple things back and forth, and now I've found a way to fix it - the multiclipboard.

**The program provides 10 clipboards numbered 0-9**

## Usage

#### Copying

1. Copy the text normally 

   CMD + C

2. Press CMD + CTRL + 0-9, depending on the clipboard number to copy the text to that clipboard

#### Pasting

1. Load the value from your chosen clipboard into the main clipboard using <CMD> + <clipboard_number>

2. Paste normally using CMD + V



That's it, enjoy! 

Please do send me any suggestions you may have!
